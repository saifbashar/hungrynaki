        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I’m Saif Bashar, an average Undergraduate Student, with thousands of
          dreams yet to be achieved . But that doesn’t affect me to dream again!
          So, I keep dreaming on and on. I love to talk,to travel,to meet new
          people and gather new experiences everyday. I don’t know where I’m
          headed to me. But before leaving this sweet little planet, I desire to
          make my thirst for the world quenched. Are you willing to spread
          helping hand or you want me to spread mine? Do let me know!

          <h2>Pizza</h2>
          <p>
            Pizza is an Italian dish consisting of a usually round, flattened
            base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and
            often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high
            temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is
            sometimes called a pizzetta.

          <h2>Fried Chicken</h2>
          <p>
            Southern fried chicken, also known simply as fried chicken, is a
            dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with
            seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried,
            or air fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the
            exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat.
